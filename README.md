# Campfire Burn Severity Prediction
This repo contains the code (Jupyter Notebook) for a research project I was involed in which studied
the use ofconvolutional neural networks to predict the burn severity of affect human structures from
the 2018 Campfire using post-wildfire aerial imagery. 

## Jupyter Notebook 
The Jupyter Notebook contains code for building and creating the dataset (images and labels), as
well as train/test split, model building, training, and test evaluation. The notebook has headers
for each of these sections. Some extras are included at the bottom of the notebook. 

## Sample dataset 
The sample dataset provides a CSV as well as one example of each image for each class.
